### Dalmuti_Deal
# Develop a Java application where you will create an 80-element array to hold the cards from The Great Dalmuti deck. Afterwards, you will ask the user how many players are in the game, and you will deal all the cards in the deck to the appropriate players.
# The game can be played with 4-8 players. However, we will assume the game is being played with 4 players. After the cards have been shuffled in the deck (moved around in the array), deal all the cards to the players. Cards are dealt one at a time from the top of the deck until all cards are given to the players.
# Display the card in the following format:
# Player1 Player2 Player 3 Player4
# ==========================================================================================
# 4: Baroness 2: Archbishop 12: Peasant 6: Knight
# 10: Shepherdess 11: Stonecutter 1: Dalmuti 3: Earl Marshal
